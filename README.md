### Description

My program allows you to easily change your name that appears in the System Properties dialog window that is located in the Control Panel. I bascially made it so that people wouldnt have to navigate to the regedit and change it manually. Just a quick little app that allows people to edit their name! easy as 1 - 2 - 3
